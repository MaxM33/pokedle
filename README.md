# Pokédle

This is a WebApp project for Sviluppo Applicazioni Web course (Web Application Development).

Pokédle is a game inspired by Wordle and LoLdle.<br>
The main goal of this game is to guess a secret pokémon.<br>

All pokémons are represented by some features such as habitat where they live, their colors, their types, their evolutions.<br>
You will be given hints on each of these categories for the pokémon you guess.<br>
These hints are represented by colors:
green is an exact match on that same category of the secret pokémon, whereas yellow is a 
partial match (meaning that one value of the two is right). Lastly, red means there's no match at all.<br>

If you want to keep track of your game stats, make sure to login with Google. 

Have fun guessin' 'em all!<br><br>

## Future Ideas
A list of ideas that probably will be implemented in the future:
- Add a reset button if user is stuck and wants to change the pokemon to guess.
- Add Bootstrap to project for all devices compatibility.
